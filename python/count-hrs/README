Count hours (useful in conjunction with timesheet logging).

While tracking activities, I log the time spent on them in HH:MM format. I then then use this script to get a total time.

Recipe: Use a spreadsheet or a CSV file with a column in HH:MM format. Then copy the columns for which you need a total time and in the shell (I am on a Mac) issue: pbpaste|count-hrs. There you go, you know the total time spent.
